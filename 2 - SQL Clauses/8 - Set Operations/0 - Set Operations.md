Set operations are operations used to manipulate and analyze sets. It includes the following operations:

1.  [**Union**](https://docs.oxla.com/union): Combines two or more sets to create a new set containing all unique elements from the input sets.

2.  [**Intersect**](https://docs.oxla.com/intersect): Yields a new set with elements common to all input sets.

3.  [**Except**](https://docs.oxla.com/except): Generates a set containing elements from the first set that are not present in the second set.

These operations allow for comparisons, combinations, and distinctions among sets in various contexts.
