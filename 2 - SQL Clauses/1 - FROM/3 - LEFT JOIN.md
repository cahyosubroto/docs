## Overview

The `LEFT JOIN`returns **all** matching records from the left table combined with the right table. Even if there are no matching records in the right table, the `LEFT JOIN` will still return a row in the result, but with NULL in each column from the right table.&#x20;

:::hint{type="info"}
ðŸ’¡ `LEFT JOIN` is also known as `LEFT OUTER JOIN`.
:::

## Syntax

:::hint{type="success"}
âœ… We support table aliasing used in the `LEFT JOIN` clause.
:::

### a) Basic Syntax

```pgsql
SELECT column_1, column_2...
FROM table_1
LEFT JOIN table_2
ON table_1.matching_field = table2.matching_field;
```

In the above syntax:

1.  `SELECT column_1, column_2... `defines the **columns **from both tables where we want the data to be selected.

2.  &#x20;`FROM table_1` defines the **left table **as the main table in the FORM clause.

3.  `RIGHT JOIN table_2` defines the **right table** as the table the main table joins.

4.  `ON table_1.matching_field = table2.matching_field` sets the join condition after the **ON** keyword with the matching field between the two tables.&#x20;

### b) Syntax with an Alias

You can use an alias to refer to the tableâ€™s name. The results will stay the same. It only helps to write the query easier.

```pgsql
SELECT A.column_1, B.column_2...
FROM table_1 A //table_1 as A
LEFT JOIN table_2 B //table_2 as B
ON A.matching_field = B.matching_field;
```

## Example

\*\* **item table\*\***

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE item (
  item_no int NOT NULL,
  item_name string
);

INSERT INTO item
    (item_no,item_name)
VALUES
    (111,'Butter'),
    (113,'Tea'),
    (116,'Bread'),
    (119,'Coffee');
```

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM item;
```

It will create a table as shown below:

```pgsql
+-----------+----------------+
| item_no   | item_name      |
+-----------+----------------+
| 111       | Butter         |
| 113       | Tea            |
| 116       | Bread          |
| 119       | Coffee         |
+-----------+----------------+
```

\*\* **invoice table\*\***

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE invoice (
  inv_no int NOT NULL,
  item int,
  sold_qty int,
  sold_price int
);

INSERT INTO invoice
    (inv_no, item, sold_qty, sold_price)
VALUES
    (020219,111,3,9000),
    (020220,116,6,30000),
    (020221,116,2,10000),
    (020222,116,1,5000),
    (020223,119,5,20000),
    (020224,119,4,16000);
```

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM invoice;
```

It will create a table as shown below:

```pgsql
+----------+---------+-----------+-------------+
| inv_no   | item    | sold_qty  | sold_price  |
+----------+---------+-----------+-------------+
| 20219    | 111     | 3         | 9000        |
| 20220    | 116     | 6         | 30000       |
| 20221    | 116     | 2         | 10000       |
| 20222    | 116     | 1         | 5000        |
| 20223    | 119     | 5         | 20000       |
| 20224    | 119     | 4         | 16000       |
+----------+---------+-----------+-------------+
```

1\) Based on the above tables, we can write a `LEFT JOIN` query as follows:

```pgsql
SELECT item_no, item_name, sold_qty, sold_price
FROM item
LEFT JOIN invoice
ON item.item_no = invoice.item;
```

- The **item** =\*\* **left table,** **and the **invoice\*\* = right table.

- Then it combines the values from the **item** table using the **item_no** and matches the records using the **item** column of each row from the **invoice **table.

- If the records are equal, a new row will be created with `item_no`**, **`item_name`**, **and\*\* \*\*`sold_qty`, `sold_price` columns as defined in the `SELECT` clause.

- **ELSE** it will create a new row with a `NULL` value from the right table **(invoice)**.&#x20;

2\) The above query will give the following result:

```pgsql
+-----------+-------------+------------+---------------+
| item_no   | item_name   | sold_qty   | sold_price    |
+-----------+-------------+------------+---------------+
| 111       | Butter      | 3          | 9000          |
| 113       | Tea         | null       | null          |
| 116       | Bread       | 6          | 30000         |
| 116       | Bread       | 2          | 10000         |
| 116       | Bread       | 1          | 5000          |
| 119       | Coffee      | 5          | 20000         |
| 119       | Coffee      | 4          | 16000         |
+-----------+-------------+------------+---------------+
```

Based on the data from the **item** and **invoice** tables:

- The result matches the total item stored in the **item **table: **4 items.**

- The result will display all the item's data from the **left table (item table), **even if there is 1 item that hasnâ€™t been sold.

- The item id: `111` matches the item `butter` and has been sold for 3pcs/9000.

- The item id: `113` matches the item `tea` but has never been sold. Thus the sold_qty & sold_price columns are filled with: null.

- The item id: `116` matches the item `Bread` and has been sold three times, for 6pcs/3000, 2pcs/10000, and 1pc/5000.

- The item id: `119` matches the item `Coffee` and has been sold two times, for 5pcs/20000 and 4pcs/16000.

:::hint{type="success"}
âœ… An **item** can have zero or many invoices. An **invoice** belongs to zero or one **item**.
