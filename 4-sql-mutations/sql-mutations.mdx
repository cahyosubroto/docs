## What are Mutations? ðŸ¤”

A mutation refers to a change made to data stored in a database. Several commands are provided for data manipulation, such as `INSERT` (adds new records), `UPDATE` (modifies existing records), and `DELETE` (deletes records).

This support has limitations:

*   Only **one data mutation (DELETE or UPDATE)** at a given moment is possible. Trying to run another one will fail.

*   Data mutations rewrite all files containing the data from the UPDATE/DELETE condition. Running `DELETE from the table` without any condition is possible, but it will be much slower than the `DROP TABLE table`.

*   The syntax is simplified in comparison to Postgres. For example, the `SET column=<value>` operation doesn't support sub-SELECT as the value, and the `WHERE` clause cannot contain sub-SELECT.

Currently, Oxla supports the following SQL mutations:
