There are several different types of distributed database management systems (DBMS). But there isn't a database system that works for everyone. Each makes different compromises to suit particular situations. In this section, we attempt to explain how Oxla differs from other OLAP-using systems.

## The Comparison

The comparison tests were performed on a single node; using more nodes will significantly improve the results. Below are the detailed prototype test results on AWS between Oxla and selected alternatives _(ClickHouse, Presto, Parquet)_:

### a) Performance

| **Oxla** | **ClickHouse** |
| -------- | -------------- |

| Supports a lot of Clauses, Data Types, and Functions. Such as `GROUP BY`, `JOIN (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, OUTER JOIN)
`&#xA;We also support uncorrelated subqueries e.g.\* `SELECT num`

- `COUNT(*)` count `FROM (SELECT ageCOUNT(*)` as num `FROM` user `GROUP BY age) ` | Non-standard SQL-like query language with several limitations.&#xA;&#xA; |
  | Oxla has homogenous architecture: there are no workers, data, or master nodes. One of the nodes is dynamically selected as the leader with no single point of failure.&#x20; | On-premise with dedicated clusters, no elasticity. We need to migrate into bigger/smaller clusters. |

### b) Cost

| **Oxla**            | **ClickHouse**     |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| $0.023 per GB/month | $0.24 per GB/month |

## Conclusion

Our tests show that Oxla's performance surpasses all other distributed database management systems with the following results:

- Oxla processes a large number of data at an extremely high data processing speed.

- Oxla can reduce 80% of data infrastructure costs compared to the others.

- Oxla will not be affected by the massive data you have. The storage (RAM) needed will stay low with a small cost you pay.

## Now What?

Understanding Oxla and then comparing it with other solutions made us realize that there are a lot of choices in today’s database market - but in the end, there will be only one .

We suggest you take a step back and evaluate your products, team talents, market, and needs before deciding what to use for your business. Choosing the right technology today can make a huge difference now and in the future.
