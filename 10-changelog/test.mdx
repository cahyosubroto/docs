## **Overview**

The `DELETE` mutation deletes one or more records from a table based on specified conditions. This support has limitations:

1.  Only **one data mutation (DELETE or UPDATE) **at a given moment is possible, trying to run another one will fail.

2.  Data mutations rewrite all files containing the data from the UPDATE/DELETE condition. Running `DELETE from the table` without any condition is possible, but it will be much slower than the `DROP TABLE table`.

3.  The syntax is simplified in comparison to Postgres. For example, the `SET column=<value>` operation doesn't support sub-SELECT as the value, and the `WHERE` clause cannot contain sub-SELECT.

**Feature Update: Initial Release**

This marks the initial release of our new Mutation feature, which allows you to update data. The Mutations involve rewriting entire files, which takes several minutes and could generate infrastructure costs.&#x20;

We are aiming to enhance and optimize this feature in future updates!

## **Syntax**

The syntax for `DELETE` mutation is as follows:

```pgsql
DELETE FROM table
WHERE conditions;
```

In this syntax:

*   `table`: The table name from which you want to delete records.

*   `WHERE conditions`** (Optional)**: The conditions must be met for the deletion to execute. If no conditions are provided, all records from the table will be deleted.

## **Example**

1\) Let's create a sample table named `orders` that track customer orders.

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    customer_name TEXT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    order_status TEXT
);

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_name, product_id, quantity, order_status)
VALUES
    (101, 'Alice Johnson', 1, 3, 'shipped'),
    (102, 'Bob Smith', 2, 1, 'pending'),
    (103, 'Charlie Brown', 3, 2, 'completed'),
    (104, 'David White', 1, 1, 'pending'),
    (105, 'Eva Davis', 4, 4, 'shipped');
```

2\) This creates a table named orders and inserts some sample data.

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM orders;
```

You'll get the following table:

```pgsql
 order_id | customer_name | product_id | quantity | order_status 
----------+---------------+------------+----------+--------------
      101 | Alice Johnson |          1 |        3 | shipped
      102 | Bob Smith     |          2 |        1 | pending
      103 | Charlie Brown |          3 |        2 | completed
      104 | David White   |          1 |        1 | pending
      105 | Eva Davis     |          4 |        4 | shipped
```

3\) Let's say we want to delete orders with a quantity less than or equal to 2.

```pgsql
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE quantity <= 2;
```

4\) The output shows that the order with `order_id`: `102`, `103`, and `104` are deleted because they have a quantity <= 2.

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM orders;
```

```pgsql
 order_id | customer_name | product_id | quantity | order_status 
----------+---------------+------------+----------+--------------
      101 | Alice Johnson |          1 |        3 | shipped
      105 | Eva Davis     |          4 |        4 | shipped
```
