## Overview

The `RANDOM()` function in Oxla generates a random number within a defined range. By default, the range is between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), resulting in a value greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1.

## Syntax

The syntax for generating a random integer or floating-point number using the `RANDOM()` function is as follows:

```pgsql
RANDOM()
```

## Examples

### Case #1: Generating a random number

The `RANDOM()` function generates a random number greater than or equal to zero (>= 0) but less than one (<1) by default. The following statement can be used to retrieve a random number:

```pgsql
SELECT RANDOM();
```

As a result, you will get a random number greater than 0 and less than 1. However, it will never return the maximum value of 1.

```pgsql
+-----------------------+
| f                     |
+-----------------------+
| 0.9122627193276355    |
+-----------------------+
```

### Case #2: Generating a random decimal number within a range

To generate a random decimal number between two values, you can use the following statement:

```pgsql
SELECT RANDOM()*(b-a)+a;
```

Where:

*   **"a"** represents the lower bound of the range.

*   **"b"** represents the upper bound of the range.

The return value will be a random floating-point number greater than or equal to a and less than b.&#x20;

****Example****

To generate a random decimal number greater than or equal to 10 and less than 25, the following statement can be used:

```pgsql
SELECT RANDOM()*(25 - 10)+10;
```

Below is an example of a random number that you may retrieve:

```pgsql
+-----------------------+
| f                     |
+-----------------------+
| 18.156098711616043    |
+-----------------------+
```

🚧 It is important to note that the function will never return the maximum value of b.
