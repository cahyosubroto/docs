## **1. Overview**

The transactions are supported only on the syntax level to allow integration with tools that requires it. While the syntax is accepted, all the queries are executed immediately and with no transactional guarantees.

## **2. Commands**

These commands are used to manage transactions:

### **2.1. BEGIN**

Initiates a new transaction by calling one of the syntax below.
<CodeGroup>

```sql BEGIN
BEGIN;
```

```sql BEGIN TRANSACTION
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
```
</CodeGroup>

### **2.2. COMMIT**

Saves the changes made in a transaction to the database. It simply ends the transaction. 
<br /> Call one of the syntax below.

<CodeGroup>

```sql COMMIT
COMMIT;
```

```sql END TRANSACTION
END TRANSACTION;
```
</CodeGroup>

### **2.3. ROLLBACK**

In Oxla, when you issue a ROLLBACK command, it doesn't undo changes made in the current transaction. It simply finishes the transaction without any rollback action.

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

## **3. Example**

1. Let's define a table named `products` with columns: `product_name`, `price`, and `stock_quantity`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE productsnew(
    product_name TEXT,
    price INT,
    stock_quantity INT
);
```

```sql
COMPLETE
```

2. Next, we want to insert product data into a `products` table.&#x20;

```sql
BEGIN;

INSERT INTO productsnew(product_name, price, stock_quantity) VALUES ('Tab', 8000, 20);
INSERT INTO productsnew(product_name, price, stock_quantity) VALUES ('Laptop', 10000, 32);
INSERT INTO productsnew(product_name, price, stock_quantity) VALUES ('Harddisk', 12000, 14);
```
<Warning>The `INSERT` statement is executed immediately without waiting for the end of the transaction or until a COMMIT is issued.</Warning>

You will get the following output:

```sql
BEGIN
INSERT 0 1
INSERT 0 1
INSERT 0 1
```

3. View the changes by displaying the products table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM productsnew;
COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK;
```

The product data is now added to the table.

```sql
 product_name | price | stock_quantity 
--------------+-------+----------------
 Harddisk     | 12000 |             14
 Tab          |  8000 |             20
 Laptop       | 10000 |             32
(3 rows)

COMMIT
```
