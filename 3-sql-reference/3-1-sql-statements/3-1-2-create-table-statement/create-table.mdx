## Overview

The `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a new table. Each table contains one or more columns, and each has a data type that defines the data that can be stored, e.g., numbers, strings, or date data.&#x20;

<Warning>The table stores the data in a **database**, so ensure that you already have one.</Warning>

## Syntax

To create a table, you should name and define the columns with their data types.

Let's see what the syntax should look like:

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE table_name(
column1 datatype,
column2 datatype,
column3 datatype,
.....
);
```

From the syntax above, we learned that to create a new table, we should:

1.  Specify the name of the new table **(table\_name)**.

2.  Specify the column's name **(column1, column2, etc..)**.

3.  Following the column’s name, specify the column’s data type (integer, string, date, and so on).

The table name of the column name can't be a keyword unless it is quoted. The unquoted name is case insensitive.

## Constraints

When creating a table, we can add the following column constraints:

**NOT NULL** – ensures that values in a column cannot be NULL and will always contain a value. In other words, if you don't define NOT NULL, the column can be empty/have no value/NULL.

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE table_name(
column1 datatype NOT NULL,
column2 datatype NOT NULL,
column3 datatype NOT NULL,
.....
);
```

## Table index

The freshly created table can contain an index. More detail [here](https://oxla.mintlify.app/3-sql-reference/3-1-sql-statements/3-1-3-create-index-statement/create-index).

<Note>By default, the table will be created in the `public` schema. Furthermore, you can also create and specify tables to other specific schemas. Click [here](https://oxla.mintlify.app/3-sql-reference/schema) for more info.</Note>

## Examples

### Case #1: Creating a new table

Let us take an example where we create an “**employees”** table with an employee id, name, and address of the employee:


```pgsql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employeeID int,
    lastName string,
    firstName string NOT NULL,
    address string
);
```

If you have made the table successfully, you will get the following output:&#x20;

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE

Query returned successfully in 263 msec.
```

You can verify it by running this command:

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

The table will be created with each defined column as shown below:

| **employeeid** | **lastname** | **firstname** | **address** |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |

<Warning>The table is only created with its headers. It doesn't have any value.</Warning>

### Case #2: Creating a new table with values

Below is an example of creating a **client** table with values:

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE client (
  client_id int,
  client_name string NOT NULL,
  client_origin string
);
INSERT INTO client 
    (client_id, client_name, client_origin) 
VALUES 
    (181891,'Oxla','Poland'),
    (181892,'Google','USA'),
    (181893,'Samsung','South Korea');
```

You can run the following command to verify the completed request:

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM client;
```

As a result, we have a table as seen below:

```pgsql
+------------+--------------+------------------+
| client_id  | client_name  | client_origin    |
+------------+--------------+------------------+
| 181891     | Oxla         | Poland           |
| 181892     | Google       | USA              | 
| 181893     | Samsung      | South Korea      |
+------------+--------------+------------------+
```

### Case #3: Quoted names

Let's try creating a table with the column named "language":

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE preferences (language TEXT);
```

This will fail with an error message:

```shell
ERROR:  syntax error, unexpected LANGUAGE, expecting IDENTIFIER (LINE:1COLUMN:27)
CREATE TABLE preferences (language TEXT);
                          ^
LINE 1: CREATE TABLE preferences (language TEXT);
                                 ^

```

It happens because "language" is a keyword. To use a keyword as a name one must use quotes:

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE preferences ("language" TEXT);
```

This will succeed. Querying this table will also require using quotes when selecting this column:

```pgsql
SELECT "language" FROM preferences;
```

Names within quotes are case-sensitive. That means that this query will fail:

```pgsql
SELECT "Language" FROM preferences;
```
