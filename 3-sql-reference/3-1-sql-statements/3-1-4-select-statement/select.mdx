## Overview

The `SELECT` statement helps you obtain the data you need from one or more tables.&#x20;

The application of this statement will be helpful in several cases listed below:

*   Evaluating data from only particular fields in a table.

*   Reviewing data from several tables at the same time.

*   Retrieving the data based on specific criteria.

## Syntax

To request data from a table using the `SELECT` statement, you can use the following syntax:

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

You are allowed to filter the table by column. Refer to the syntax below.

```pgsql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

We will define each syntax as follows.

*   `SELECT` determines the data we need from the database or a table.

*   `* `referred to as ***select star*** or ***asterisk*** or represents ***all***. It defines that the query should return all columns of the queried tables.

*   `FROM` clause indicates the table(s) to retrieve data from.

*   `table_name` represents the table(s) name.

*   `column1, column2, ...` these are used to specify the columns from where we want to retrieve the data.

‚ÑπÔ∏è The `SELECT` statement is case insensitive, which means `select`** or **`SELECT` has the same result.

## Examples

We have a table named **student\_data **that stores the id, name, and where the student lives.

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE student_data (
  id int,
  name string,
  domicile string
);
INSERT INTO student_data 
    (id, name, domicile) 
VALUES 
    (119291,'Jordan','Los Angeles'),
    (119292,'Mike','Melbourne'),
    (119293,'Will','Sydney');
```

All the examples below are executed in the `public` schema. You can also display table from another specific schema. Click [here](https://docs.oxla.com/schema) for more info.
:::

### #Case 1: Query data from all columns

1\) In the first case, we want to display all the data from the **student\_data** table. Please refer to the syntax below:

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

2\) Use the `SELECT` statement within the table name to get all the data:

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM student_data;
```

3\) If you have successfully run the query, you will get all the data from the **student\_data **table.

```pgsql
+--------+----------+----------------+
| id     | name     | domicile       |
+--------+----------+----------------+
| 119291 | Jordan   | Los Angeles    | 
| 119292 | Mike     | Melbourne      |
| 119293 | Will     | Sydney         |
+--------+----------+----------------+
```

### #Case 2: Query data from specific columns

1\) We want to get the list of students' names with their IDs. Please refer to the syntax below:

```pgsql
SELECT column_1, column_2 FROM table_name;
```

2\) Run the following query:

```pgsql
SELECT id, name FROM student_data;
```

3\) If you have successfully run the query, you will get a list of students' IDs & names from the **student\_data **table.

```pgsql
+--------+----------+
| id     | name     | 
+--------+----------+
| 119291 | Jordan   | 
| 119292 | Mike     |
| 119293 | Will     | 
+--------+----------+
```

### #Case 3: Query data from a specific column with the condition

1\) If we have a large number of data, skimming for the desired data will require a long time. We can apply some conditions to the `SELECT` statement. Please refer to the syntax below:

```pgsql
SELECT column_1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

2\) Let's say we want to know the student's name who lives in Sydney, have a look and run the query below:

```pgsql
SELECT name FROM student_data WHERE domicile='Sydney';
```

&#x20;3\) If you have successfully run the query, we now know that Will lives in Sydney! üá¶üá∫

```pgsql
+----------+ 
| name     | 
+----------+
| Will     | 
+----------+
```
