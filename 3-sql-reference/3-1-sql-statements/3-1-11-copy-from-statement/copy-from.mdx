## **Overview**

**COPY FROM** is used to import data from a file into a table by reading from the file directly. When using the COPY FROM, each field in the file is inserted sequentially into the specified column.

:::hint{type="info"}
The file must be accessible and able to be read and written to.
:::

## **Syntax**

The syntax for** COPY FROM** is as follows:&#x20;

```pgsql
COPY table_name FROM 'file_path';
```

Two parameters need to be specified in the syntax:

*   `table_name`: the table that will receive data from the file.

*   `file_path`: a link to the file location accessible from the server.&#x20;

## **Example**

### Step #1: Create a CSV File

First, you should create a CSV file and store it on your local computer. Here, we make a file called **“feature2.csv” **that stores features with its version.

> create a table, 1.0
> modify a table, 1.2
> drop a table, 2.2
> rename a table, 2.0

### Step #2: Import FIle from Local to Server

You can use the syntax below for importing the file to the server:

```typescript
aws s3 cp ~/[file location on your local computer] s3://[server location]/[file name]
```

Next, import the file to the server using the above syntax as shown below:

```typescript
aws s3 cp ~/Documents/feature2.csv s3://oxla-testdata/cayo/feature2.csv
```

If it’s successfully imported, you will get the following result:

```typescript
upload: Documents/feature2.csv to s3://oxla-testdata/cayo/feature2.csv
```

### Step #3: Connect to Oxla Server

The file has been successfully uploaded to the server ✅. Now, connect to the Oxla server using the command below:

```pgsql
psql -h buildfarm.oxla.com -p 6000
```

If you get the output below, you are currently in the Oxla environment.

```pgsql
psql (15.1 (Ubuntu 15.1-1.pgdg22.10+1), server Oxla 1.0)
WARNING: psql major version 15, server major version 0.0.
         Some psql features might not work.
Type "help" for help.
```

### Step #4: Create a Table

Before creating a table, check for duplicate tables with the statement below:

```pgsql
DESCRIBE DATABASE
```

In return, you will retrieve a list of existing tables in the Oxla.&#x20;

```pgsql
+----------------------------+
| name                       |
+----------------------------+
| supplier_scale_1_no_index  |
| features                   |
| orders                     |
| features2                  |
| featurestable              |
| featurestable1             |
| featurestable10            |
+----------------------------+
```

:::hint{type="warning"}
Ensure you are not creating duplicate tables.
:::

We need to create a table to retrieve the data from the CSV file. Here we will create a “**featurelisttable**” table. Using the same data type as described in the file is recommended.

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE featurelisttable (featurename string, version float);
```

### Step #5: Copy the CSV File Into Table

Now, copy **“feature2.csv”** by executing the COPY FROM query below:

```pgsql
COPY featurelisttable FROM 's3://oxla-testdata/cayo/feature2.csv';
```

You will get the following successful result:

```pgsql
--
(0 rows)
```

### Step #6: Retrieve the Table

To verify that the data was imported correctly from the server, retrieve all the data using the SELECT statement:

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM featurelisttable;
```

You will have the same data in the table as in the CSV file.

```pgsql
+-----------------+----------+
| featurename     | version  | 
+-----------------+----------+
| create a table  | 1        |
| modify a table  | 1.2      |
| drop a table    | 2.2      |
| rename a table  | 2        |
+-----------------+----------+
```
