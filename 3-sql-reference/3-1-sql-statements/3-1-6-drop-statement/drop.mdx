## Overview

In this section, we will learn how to delete the data from a table using the `DROP` statement.

<Warning>Running a `DROP` statement will also delete all existing records from the table.</Warning>

## Syntax

The basic syntax for the `DROP` statement is as follows:

```pgsql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

In this syntax, we have several elements that are elaborated on below.

1.  `DROP` represents the statement name.&#x20;

2.  `TABLE` entity type you want to drop.

3.  `table_name` defines which table you want to remove.&#x20;

<Tip>The `DROP` example below is executed in the `public` schema. You can also drop a table from another specific schema. Click [here](https://oxla.mintlify.app/3-sql-reference/schema) for more info.</Tip>

## Example

We have a table named **warehouse** that stores the product's id, name, and quantity:

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE warehouse (
  id int,
  product string,
  qty int
);
INSERT INTO warehouse 
    (id, product, qty) 
VALUES 
    (889771,'Shirt',22),
    (777821,'Hat',99),
    (103829,'Bed Cover',12);
```

```pgsql
 SELECT * FROM warehouse;
```

It will create a table as shown below:

```pgsql
+---------+------------+---------+
| id      | product    | qty     | 
+---------+------------+---------+
| 889771  | Shirt      | 22      |
| 777821  | Hat        | 99      |
| 103829  | Bed Cover  | 12      |
+---------+------------+---------+
```

***

1. Use the following query to delete the warehouseâ€™s table:

```pgsql
DROP TABLE warehouse;
```

2. If you have successfully run the query, you will get the following output: the table and the values within it are deleted.

```pgsql
DROP TABLE

Query returned successfully in 284 msec.
```

<Note>If you attempt to use the table for any operation, you will find that the table no longer exists.</Note>
