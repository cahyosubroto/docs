## Overview

The `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` returns the current timestamp value representing the date and time the query was executed.

:::hint{type="info"}
ℹ️ Note that the time returned by this function is the time when the query was executed.
:::

### Syntax

```pgsql
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(precision)
```

The `precision` is used to set the number of digits in the fractional seconds precision in the **second** field.

If you omit the `precision`, the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` function will return a current timestamp that includes the complete fractional seconds precision.

:::hint{type="warning"}
⚠️ The maximum precision value that you can input is 6.

## Examples

### #Case 1: Current timestamp

The following example shows how to get the current date and time with a `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`function:

```pgsql
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS "Current Time";
```

The final result will display the current date and time in your timezone:

```pgsql
+-----------------------------+
| Current Time                |
+-----------------------------+
| 2022-08-31 16:56:06.464016  |
+-----------------------------+
```

### #Case 2: Current timestamp with precision

Let’s assume we want to get the current timestamp but with a 2-fractional seconds precision:

```pgsql
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(2);
```

The function will return the current date and time with 2 digits after seconds:

```pgsql
+-------------------------+
| current_timestamp       |
+-------------------------+
| 2022-08-31 17:15:22.16  |
+-------------------------+
```
