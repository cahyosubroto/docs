Set operations are operations used to manipulate and analyze sets. It includes the following operations:

1.  [**Union**](https://oxla.mintlify.app/3-sql-reference/3-2-sql-clauses/3-2-8-set-operations/union): Combines two or more sets to create a new set containing all unique elements from the input sets.
2.  [**Intersect**](https://oxla.mintlify.app/3-sql-reference/3-2-sql-clauses/3-2-8-set-operations/intersect): Yields a new set with elements common to all input sets.

3.  [**Except**](https://oxla.mintlify.app/3-sql-reference/3-2-sql-clauses/3-2-8-set-operations/except): Generates a set containing elements from the first set that are not present in the second set.

These operations allow for comparisons, combinations, and distinctions among sets in various contexts.
