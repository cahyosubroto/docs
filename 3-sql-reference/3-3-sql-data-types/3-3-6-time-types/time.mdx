## Overview

The `TIME` data type in Oxla stores time values without any date information. It represents a specific time of day, independent of any time zone or date.&#x20;

## Format

The format for the TIME data type is as follows:

```pgsql
HH:MM:SS[.SSSSSS]
```

*   `HH`: One or two-digit hour (valid values from 00 to 23).

*   `MM`: One or two-digit minutes (valid values from 00 to 59).

*   `SS`: One or two-digit seconds (valid values from 00 to 59).

*   `[.SSSSSS]` : Optional fractional seconds, with up to six decimal places (microsecond precision).

## Examples

### #Case 1: Create a Schedule Table

Let's create a table to manage employee schedules, containing their names and the time they are scheduled to start work. The TIME data type will be used for the `start_time` column.

```pgsql
CREATE TABLE employee_schedule (
    employee_name TEXT,
    start_time TIME
);

INSERT INTO employee_schedule (employee_name, start_time)
VALUES
('John Doe', '08:30:00'),
('Jane Smith', '09:00:00'),
('Michael Johnson', '10:15:00');
```

The table has been successfully created after executing the above query:

```pgsql
COMPLETE
INSERT 0 3
```

### #Case 2: View the Employee Schedule

To view all employee schedules in the `employee_schedule` table, we can use the `SELECT` statement.

```pgsql
SELECT * FROM employee_schedule;
```

The output will display the employee names and their corresponding scheduled start times:

```pgsql
  employee_name  |   start_time    
-----------------+-----------------
 John Doe        | 08:30:00.000000
 Jane Smith      | 09:00:00.000000
 Michael Johnson | 10:15:00.000000
(3 rows)
```
